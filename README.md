#What This Framework Does

- Translates CT brain volumes to synthetic MRI using three different architectures including the UNet, Attention UNet and SwinUNetR.
- Utilizes patch-wise GAN training for memory-efficient learning.
- Evaluates voxel-level fidelity using MAE, PSNR, and SSIM inside anatomical masks.
- Supports both training and k-fold cross-validation modes.
- These modifications can be adjusted easily from Main.py.

#Dataset Format

Each patient folder should contain:

dataset_root/
â”œâ”€â”€ patient001/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ mr.nii.gz # ground-truth MRI 
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ct.nii.gz # input CT
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ mask.nii.gz # evaluation mask


To train the model:

python main.py
